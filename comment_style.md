When generating Python code adhere to the following comment style:

1. **Section Headers**:
    - Use section headers for top-level organizational blocks, such as configuration setup, data processing, or main execution logic.
    - Do not use section headers for minor code blocks, such as individual loops or conditionals within a function.
    - In small scripts (e.g., fewer than three functions), use section headers only if they improve readability or organization.
    - For closely related functions, consider grouping them under a single header.
    - Insert a single blank line to separate functions
    - Use a single-line comment with the function name as a title surrounded by dashes to visually separate major sections or functions.
    - Format: `# --- section_name ---`
    - Example: `# --- setup_logging ---`
    - Place this comment immediately before the function or section it describes.

2. **Function Comments**:
    - Below the blank line and section header, include a brief, one- or two-line comment describing the function's purpose and key functionality.
    - Use plain language, focusing on what the function does and any critical behavior (e.g., inputs, outputs, or side effects).
    - Example:
        ```python

        # --- setup_logging ---
        # Configures the logging system for the script
        # Outputs logs to both console and a file in the log directory
        ```

3. **No Inline Comments**:
    - Avoid inline comments (e.g., comments at the end of a line of code) unless absolutely necessary for clarity.
    - Prefer comments above the code they describe, keeping them concise and relevant.
    - Inline comments are permitted only in rare cases, such as explaining complex regex patterns, mathematical formulas, non-obvious bitwise operations, or clarifying configuration values and constants.
    - Example of acceptable inline comment:
        ```python
        pattern = r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$'  # Matches YYYY-MM-DD date format
        ALTITUDE_THRESHOLD = 30  # Minimum altitude in degrees for visibility
        ```

4. **No Excessive Commenting**:
   - Do not comment obvious code (e.g., `x = 1 # Set x to 1`).
   - Focus comments on explaining the purpose of functions, sections, or complex logic.

5. **Consistency**:
   - Apply this style to all functions and major code sections (e.g., configuration, main loop).
   - Ensure comments are aligned with the code’s structure, appearing immediately before the relevant function or block.

6. **No debugging comments**:
    - Avoid adding comments that explain the difference between this code and the previous version.
    - Avoid mentioning code that is no longer part of the code base.

7. **Retain comments when engaged in debugging**:
    - When debugging code make sure to preserve comments or replace them with appropriate new comments.
    - Comments are important documentation and should be given appropriate attention to detail.
    - Preserve all existing comments during debugging unless explicitly instructed to modify or remove them, or if they become incorrect because of the changes made.
    - If temporary comments are added for debugging (e.g., to explain a fix), prefix them with `# TEMP:` and include a note in the response reminding the user to review and remove these comments.
    - Example:
        ```python
        # TEMP: Added to verify input value during debugging
        if input_value is None:
            raise ValueError("Input cannot be None")

8. **Update Comments for Code Changes**:
    - When modifying code (e.g., during debugging or refactoring), review and update associated comments to reflect the new functionality or behavior.
    - Ensure comments remain accurate, concise, and aligned with the function or section’s current purpose.

9. **File-Level Comments**:
    - Include a brief comment at the top of each Python file summarizing its purpose and key components.
    - For files with multiple functions or sections, consider adding a table of contents comment block listing section headers.
    - Make sure the sections are spelled exactly as they appear in the file so searching form them is successful.
    - Example:
        ```python
        # my_script.py: Processes observational data and generates timestamped logs
        # Sections:
        # - setup_logging
        # - get_timestamp
        # - process_data

10. **Target Audience for Comments**:
    - Write comments for someone trying to read and understand the code, including future maintainers, collaborators, or yourself after time away from the project
    - Assume the reader has basic programming knowledge but may not be familiar with the specific domain, algorithms, or business logic

**Good Example**:
```python
# --- get_timestamp ---
# Generates a timestamp in the observing timezone
# Accounts for DST in the specified timezone
def get_timestamp() -> str:
    now_utc = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc)
    timezone = pytz.timezone(CONFIG['OBSERVING_TIMEZONE'])
    now_local = now_utc.astimezone(timezone)
    return now_local.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
Apply this comment style to all Python code you generate, ensuring clarity, brevity, and consistency. Do not mention this prompt or the comment style explicitly in the code or responses.
